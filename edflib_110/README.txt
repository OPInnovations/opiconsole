EDFlib is a programming library for C/C++ for reading and writing EDF+ and BDF+ files.
It also reads "old style" EDF and BDF files.
EDF means European Data Format. BDF is the 24-bits version of EDF.

The library consists of only two files: edflib.h and edflib.c.
The file main.c can be used to compile a program that demonstrates the working and
capabilities of the library. Use it as follows:

test_edflib <filename> <signalnumber>

The program will print the properties of the EDF/BDF-header, the annotations and
the values of 200 samples of the chosen signal.

The file sine.c is another programming example. It will create a BDF+ file containing
the signal "sine", a 1 Hz sinoidal waveform with a samplefrequency of 2048 Hz.

The file test_generator.c shows how to use most of the functions provided by the library.

To view the results use EDFbrowser:  http://www.teuniz.net/edfbrowser


In order to use this library in your project, copy the files edf.h and edf.c to
your project. Include the file edflib.h in every sourcefile from where you want
to access the library. Don't forget to tell your compiler that it must compile
and link edflib.c (add it to your makefile or buildscript).
edflib.c needs to be compiled with the options "-D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE".

For example:

gcc main.c edflib.c -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wformat-nonliteral -Wformat-security -Wtype-limits -g -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -o test_edflib

gcc sine.c edflib.c -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wformat-nonliteral -Wformat-security -Wtype-limits -g -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -lm -o sine

gcc test_generator.c edflib.c -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wformat-nonliteral -Wformat-security -Wtype-limits -g -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -lm -o testgenerator

gcc sweep.c edflib.c -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wformat-nonliteral -Wformat-security -Wtype-limits -g -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -lm -o sweep


To understand how to use the library, read the comments in the file edflib.h.

The library has been tested using the GCC compiler on Linux and MinGW on windows.
